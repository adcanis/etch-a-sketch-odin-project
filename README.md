# Etch - A - Sketch

![alt text](https://github.com/adcanis/etch-a-sketch-odin-project/blob/main/images/etchasketchreadme.jpg)

A classic toy reimagined for The Odin Project's Foundations course. 

This particular project represents possibly one too many coffees. With that said however, I found this project challenging and very stimulating as learning to create items in HTML from JavaScript was a fresh idea learned mearly hours before attempting this project. 

**What I learned**

- How to create a grid system in JavaScript that looped over for a set size. 
- How to add eventListeners to buttons and mouseovers to get user feedback from the front end. 

I plan on revisiting this project to add a design that resembles the toy more.
